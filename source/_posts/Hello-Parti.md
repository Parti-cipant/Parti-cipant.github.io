## Introduction to this website

### Why creating this new blog

As I started an 6-month placement from July, there are a lot of new things for me to learn. Therefore, I plan to have a record of the problems and difficulty that I have met with to offer a reference to the future. Also, I going to write down some personal feeling and interesting experiences. What's more, my written English has been backsliding since I entered University, so this blog is used for practicing my written English as well. 


### Why this theme

When I was in my high school, during COVD-19, I have already started working on my own blog through GitHub Pages. When I looked back to that time, some complicated emotion just came to me, including the miss for that interesting period, the shock of the changes happened on myself, etc. This website is still under the frame Hexo. It used to have a theme called sakura, but for me now, it is too fancy. Now, I prefer things that are concise and informative. ~~Maybe this is a the signal that I am getting older.~~
